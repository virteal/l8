the statements\r\nof a function. This is quite verbose however. But not so much when using\r\nCoffeeScript. This is why, after considering the idea years ago, I waited\r\nuntil now to implement it. That my cousin Jean Vincent would consider breaking\r\na function into steps as something close enough to threading was another strong\r\nmotivator.\r\n\r\nTo break functions into steps, I use a DSL (domain specific language) API.\r\nOnce the AST (abstact syntax tree) is built, I interpret it.\r\n\r\nThis becomes really interesting when the AST gets dynamically modified!\r\n\r\nExecutable nodes in the AST are called \"steps\". They are the smallest non\r\ninterruptible executable entities. Each Step belongs to a Path. Task can\r\ninvolve sub tasks that cooperate across multiple paths.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMainTask\r\n  Task.1 - a task with a single path with a loop\r\n    MainPath\r\n      Step\r\n      Step\r\n      RepeatStep\r\n        Step\r\n        Step\r\n      Step\r\n  Task.2 - a task with two paths\r\n    MainPath\r\n      Step\r\n      Step\r\n    ForkedPath\r\n      Step\r\n  Task.3 - a task with two simple sub tasks\r\n    MainPath\r\n      Step\r\n        SubTask\r\n          MainPath\r\n            Step\r\n        SubTask\r\n          MainPath\r\n            Step\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n"]],"start1":6771,"start2":6771,"length1":343,"length2":2422}]],"length":9193,"saved":false}

One key characteristic\r\nof the language is the fact that all these statements are \"non blocking\". This\r\nmeans that no statements can \"block\". They are executed with no delay, they\r\ncannot \"wait\" for something to happen.\r\n\r\nAs a result there is only one \"thread\" of execution and any activity that\r\ncannot complete immediately needs to register code to excute later when\r\nsome \"event\" occurs. This single thread runs a tight loop that consumes events\r\nand run code registered to handle them. This is \"the event loop\"\r\n\r\n  while( true ){\r\n    event = get_event()\r\n    dispatch( event)\r\n  }\r\n\r\nCode that is executed when an event happens is often named \"callback\". This is\r\nbecause it is the \"event loop\" (though \"dispatch()\") that \"calls\" that code.\r\n\r\n  function process_mouse_over(){\r\n    obj.onmouseover = call_me_back;\r\n    function call_me_back(){\r\n      // called when mouse runs over that obj\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nThat event_loop/callback style is simple and efficient. However, it has some\r\nnotorious drawbacks. Things can get fairly complex to handle when some activity\r\ninvolve many sub-activities that must be run in some specific order.\r\n\r\nMultiple solutions exist to care with such cases. The most basic one is to\r\nstart a new activity from within the callback that gets called when the\r\nprevious activity is completed.\r\n\r\n  ajax_get_user( name, function user_found( user ){\r\n    ajax_check_credential( user, function credential_checked( is_ok ){\r\n      if( is_ok ){\r\n        ajax_do_action( user, \"delete\", function delete_result( err ){\r\n          if( err ) signal( err)\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nThis code is not very readable because of the \"nesting\" of the different parts\r\nthat obscure it.\r\n\r\n  ajax_get_user( name, user_found);\r\n  function user_found( user ){\r\n    ajax_check_credential( user, credential_checked);\r\n  }\r\n  function credential_checked( is_ok ){\r\n    if( !is_ok )return\r\n    ajax_do_action( user, \"delete\", delete_result)\r\n  }\r\n  function delete_result( err ){\r\n    if( err ) signal( err)\r\n  }\r\n\r\nThis slightly different style is barely more readable.
